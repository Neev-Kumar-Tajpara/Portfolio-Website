# Introduction

In high-frequency trading (HFT), the half-life of alpha signals has compressed significantly over the last decade. Conventional wisdom suggests that order book imbalance (OBI) provides predictive power, but the window of opportunity is fleeting.

## Mathematical Formulation

We define the Order Book Imbalance $I_t$ at time $t$ as:

$$
I_t = \frac{V_t^b - V_t^a}{V_t^b + V_t^a}
$$

Where $V_t^b$ and $V_t^a$ are the volumes at the best bid and ask, respectively.

We model the evolution of the mid-price $P_t$ as a stochastic differential equation (SDE):

$$
dP_t = \alpha(I_t) dt + \sigma dW_t
$$

Where $\alpha(I_t)$ is the drift function dependent on the imbalance, and $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion.

### Alpha Decay Model

We propose that $\alpha(I_t)$ decays according to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process:

$$
d\alpha_t = -\theta (\alpha_t - \mu) dt + \eta dB_t
$$

Here, $\theta$ represents the speed of mean reversion—the critical parameter defining alpha decay.

## Empirical Results

Using tick data from NSE NIFTY 50 Futures, we estimated $\theta$.

| Timeframe | Estimated $\theta$ | Decay Half-Life (ms) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2018-2019 | 0.85 | 815 |
| 2020-2021 | 1.42 | 488 |
| 2022-2023 | 2.95 | 235 |

## Conclusion

The market is becoming more efficient at absorbing imbalance information. Strategies relying on simple OBI must now execute within sub-200ms windows to capture meaningful edge, or incorporate higher-order derivatives of the limit order book (LOB).
